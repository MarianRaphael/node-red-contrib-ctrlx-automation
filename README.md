# Node-RED nodes for ctrlX AUTOMATION

This package contains nodes to easily connect to [ctrlX AUTOMATION](https://www.ctrlx-automation.com/) devices from [Bosch Rexroth](https://www.boschrexroth.com).

Using the nodes you can read and write to the ctrlX Data Layer. These nodes can be installed directly on a ctrlX CORE device as well as on a third-party device which runs Node-RED.

## Installation

Install using the managed palette from inside Node-RED.

## Usage

There are two new nodes which appear in the category 'ctrlX AUTOMATION' in your Node-RED palette.

#### Data Layer Request

This node allows read, write or browse of items in the ctrlX Data Layer. To execute the request, the node needs to be triggered by an input `msg`. The arguments can be given in the node properties or programmatically via the input `msg`.

#### Data Layer Subscribe

This node allows to subscribe to value changes of an item in the ctrlX Data Layer. It is an input node, which does not need to be triggered, but automatically emits a new `msg`, when the value changes. This node is very efficient, because it does not poll but only publish server sent events. Monitoring of the value is done on server side.

### Examples

There are multiple example flows included which demonstrate how the node can be use.
They appear under the Examples section of the library import menu in Node-RED.
